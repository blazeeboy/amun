module Amun
  # = Event manager
  # Stores a stack of methods to call for each event,
  # when an event is triggered it executes methods in Last-In-First-Out
  # if a method returned true it continue execution of the next item in stack,
  # if the method returned false it will stop executing the rest of stack.
  #
  # == Usage
  # could be used to register keyboard events, registering a set of actions to
  # be executed when a key combination is pressed, the stack implementation will
  # help stop execution at certain action if it needs to hijack that key.
  #
  # Also could be used to as instrumentation tool between modules, some modules
  # register for event, and others fire it when happens, e.g *Window*
  # module needs to update it's title when a file is saved, so it
  # register *update_title* method to *after_file_save* event,
  # when the *Buffer* module saves a file it should trigger
  # that event, which executed the *update_title*.

    # if talking to a specific instance, this global trigger
    # will be handled by one of the editor toplevel components
    # and it should be the lowest priority, if every thing else
    # can't handle the event it should ask this class if anyone
    # registered something globally to handle this event.
    #
    # if you want to handle events in your major mode, minor modes
    # or anything that the application will ask it to trigger event
    # you need to instanciate an object, if you need your action to
    # the default and should be handled globally, like exiting the application
    # or changing theme, or changing some global variable, update packages
    # or any similar global actions, then using the class methods will
    # make sense here.
